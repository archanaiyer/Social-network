This is the last in the series of projects to develop a nano blogging website using Django and Python.
It is a featureful, interactive web application including user registration and authentication, 
email integration for user verification, photo upload and quasi real time updates.

I have deployed my application on Heroku and used POstgres for the database.  
Images are saved in Amazon S3.

The URL for the deployed application is:

https://morning-gorge-3980.herokuapp.com/socialnetwork/

The database being used is PostgreSQl and the images are saved in Amazon S3.

CSS framework used: http://materializecss.com/about.html
